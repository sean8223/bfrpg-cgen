# BFRPG Character Generator

A first level character generator designed for use with the [Basic Fantasy Role Playing Game](https://basicfantasy.org).

Implements character generation using [Equipment Packs](https://basicfantasy.org/downloads/BF-Equipment-Packs-r1.pdf) and two house rules:

* Max HP at first level
* Trading ability scores 2:1 as in Moldvay B/X D&D.

## Quick Start

This is a single-page web application with no server-side dependencies. It can be run locally by opening `index.html` in a browser. An internet connection is required as it will attempt to download [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) components and [Font Awesome Icons](https://fontawesome.com/v4.7.0/icons/).

## Known Issues/Limitations

* It is possible to create illegal combinations of race/class/equipment
* The visual layout/CSS is very much a work in progress
